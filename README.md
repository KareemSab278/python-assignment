# User Dashboard Flask Application

## Overview

This is a simple web application built for a bootcamp assignment using **Python**, **Flask**, and **SQLite**. It allows users to manage a list of users by adding new users through a form, viewing them in a dashboard, and deleting them by their ID. The application features a clean, boxed UI for both the form and user display, with automatic page refreshing after successful deletions.

### Features
- **Add Users**: Submit a form to add a new user with name, email, user ID tag, age, and password.
- **View Users**: Display all users in a grid of styled boxes, fetched dynamically via JavaScript.
- **Delete Users**: Remove users by their numeric ID with a confirmation prompt and page refresh on success.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic CSS styling with boxed containers for a polished look.

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**: Backend logic and database operations.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for routing and templating.
- **SQLite**: Simple file-based database for storing user data.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for form submission, user display, and dynamic updates.
